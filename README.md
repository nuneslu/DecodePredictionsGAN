# DecodePredictionsGAN

This repository uses the resnet network pretrained on cifar100 dataset to classify some images labels and then decode those predictions using a GAN pretrained on EMNIST dataset, to convert to predictions to letters.

To do the predictions and GAN decoding run the command:

```
python3 main.py
```
